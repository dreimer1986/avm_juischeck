v2.1.1 (2021/04/02)
-------------------
Change: Updated Italian localization (thanks bovirus).
Fix: HTTPS downloads failed because TLS1.2 was not enabled.

Note: HTTPS downloads require Windows 7 or later as Windows
      Vista and earlier do not support TLS1.2.

v2.1.0 (2020/10/19)
-------------------
Change: DECT: use JUIS instead of CATI server to search for updates.
New: DECT: view update info (release notes) in web browser.
Fix: DECT: update search with language other than German returned
     an error.
Fix: DECT: support for 5-part version numbers (FRITZ!DECT 500).

Note: If you have a FRITZ!DECT 500 in a device collection, you must
      either correct the firmware version manually or do an update
      search and make the found version current. JuisCheck did not
      handle 5-part version numbers correctly prior to v2.1.0.

v2.0.3 (2020/10/16)
-------------------
Change: 'Upgrade' predefined DECT base to FRITZ!OS 7.21.
Change: No firmware major version warning if Hardware == FirmwareMajor
        for Hardware >= 249 (FRITZ!Powerline 1260v2). This limit is an
        educated guess and may change in the future.
New: Support for LabPLUS firmware type string (build type 1007)
Fix: Highlight new updates also for DECT devices.
Fix: Beta (Labor) DECT firmware cannot be found with beta (Labor)
     FRITZ!OS version (wrong FRITZ!OS version format in query).

v2.0.2 (2020/04/21)
-------------------
Change: Updated Italian localization (thanks bovirus).
New: Highlight new updates (i.e. updates that differ from the current
     value in the Update column).
Doc: updated README.md
Doc: added CONTRIBUTING.md

v2.0.1 (2020/04/13)
-------------------
New: Predefined DECT base device (FRITZ!Box 7590 with FRITZ!OS 7.12).
New: German localization.
New: Show download file name in download window caption.
Fix: Application restart message is shown when resetting settings to
     default even if the UI language setting is already default.
Fix: Backstage panel width is too small for German localization.

v2.0.0 (2020/04/04)
-------------------
Note: JuisCheck v2 is a major release that comes with some breaking changes.
      Please consult the README.md file for details about upgrading from
      JuisCheck v1.x.
Change: Requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later (Windows Vista or later).
Change: New collection XML file format (incompatible with JuisCheck 1.x).
Change: Column visibility is saved in the collection XML file.
Change: Use built-in engine to download firmware images instead of launching
        the default web browser as web browsers are dropping FTP support.
Change: No firmware major version warning if Hardware == FirmwareMajor for
        Hardware >= 252 (FRITZ!Box 6660 Cable). This limit is an educated
        guess and may change in the future.
New: Select device as Mesh master for non-DECT devices.
New: Select device as DECT base for DECT devices.
New: Column for Mesh master / DECT base (replaces Base Fritz!OS column).
New: Select default columns for new collections (in backstage settings).
New: Select user interface language (default: automatic).
New: Italian localization (thanks bovirus).
New: Support for build type 1006 (TEST beta).
New: Support for devices like DECT 500 which have a different firmware
     file name format (5 version parts instead of 4).
New: Portable mode.
New: Menu item icons in backstage.
New: Exit the program with Ctrl-X.
Fix: Device information tooltip is not updated after data change.
Fix: Device information tooltip date/time format is inconsistent with
     table date/time format.
Fix: FileNotFoundException is thrown at startup when trying to autoload
     a file that does not exist (eg. because it has been renamed or
     deleted).
Fix: Firmware version string is not updated after build type change under
     certain circumstances.
Fix: Some version formats in the update info cannot not be parsed. JuisCheck
     can now handle a wide variety of formats.
Fix: Flags text box height is too small on Windows 10.

v1.4.2 (2019/06/23)
-------------------
New: Support for build type 1007 (PLUS beta).
Fix: Update version 149.07.08-67660Labor for FRITZ!Box 7560 could not be
     made current due to missing white space between the build number (67660)
     and the build type qualifier (Labor). The update version is a string
     that is apparently hand crafted by AVM which may cause unanticipated
     format variations.

v1.4.1 (2019/03/07)
-------------------
New: Keyboard shortcuts for all ribbon buttons.
Fix: Datagrid keyboard navigation did not work correctly when focus was
     returned to the datagrid (e.g. after adding or editing a device).
Fix: Update version 105.06.85i for FRITZ!Box 6840 LTE International could
     not be made current due to the trailing 'i'.

v1.4.0 (2018/12/29)
-------------------
New: Add a device that is a copy of the selected device.
New: JuisCheck remembers the directory of the last successful 'Open' or
     'Save As' dialog. Opening a device collection from the Recent Files
     list does not change the remembered directory.
Fix: The column width would jump when resizing a column to a width less
     than the column header text width.
Fix: The sort direction was only cleared on the 'Device name' and 'Product
     name' columns when a new device collection was opened or the current
     collection was closed.
Fix: The column width was not reset to Auto when a new device collection
     was opened or the current collection was closed.
Fix: The 'Update file name' column was not cleared in the data grid when
     an update was made current.

v1.3.0 (2018/12/28)
-------------------
New: Setting to automatically load the current device collection at next
     program start.

v1.2.0 (2018/12/27)
-------------------
New: Support for the legacy jason_boxinfo.xml device information. When a
     request for juis_boxinfo.xml fails with HTTP error 404 (Not Found),
     JuisCheck will make a request for jason_boxinfo.xml. A heuristic is
     used to determine the firmware build type from the Lab element (the
     default is Release).

v1.1.0 (2018/12/25)
-------------------
New: Recent files context menu: open file, remove file from the list.
New: Recent files: button to remove all files from the list.
New: Hide/show datagrid columns via a context menu on the column headers.
New: Datagrid columns for hardware, country, language and update file name
     (hidden by default).
New: Button to reset settings to defaults.
Fix: The device information tooltip on the datagrid was garbled ('Update file
     name' and 'Last checked' fields were in the same row for non-DECT devices).
Change: Base Fritz!OS column is hidden by default.

v1.0.1 (2018/12/24)
-------------------
Fix: JuisCheck would exit silently in case of an unhandled exception. It now
     displays an error message and attempts to copy the exception data to the
     clipboard before exiting.
Fix: A COMException might be thrown when copying image URLs to the clipboard.
     The cause is probably that the clipboard is locked by another program
     (e.g. some tool that monitors the clipboard). JuisCheck now retries
     in case of errors and displays an error message if all attempts fail.
Fix: JuisCheck used Linux style newline (\n) when copying multiple URLs to
     the clipboard instead of Windows style newline (\r\n).
Fix: The tooltips of the Recent and Settings backstage menu buttons would
     also be shown on the panel area. The tooltips are now restricted to the
     button area.

v1.0.0 (2018/12/20)
-------------------
Initial release
